# Personal Blog Go Implementation
 A simple personal blog built with Go (Golang) featuring a guest section for viewing articles and an admin section for managing content. Users can publish, edit, and delete articles stored in JSON format. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to web development with Go, focusing on file-based storage, basic authentication, and templating.
